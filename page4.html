    <p><b><mark>True love begins with the self. Cultivating a deep sense of self-worth and acceptance is essential before extending love to others. When we love ourselves, we establish healthy relationships with family, friends, and partners.</mark></b></p>
    
    <p style="font-size: xx-large;">Loving your family means supporting them while recognizing your boundaries; it's about being there for them without losing yourself in their needs. In friendships, nurturing bonds while ensuring you don't sacrifice your happiness or well-being for others is vital. With a partner, love should uplift and inspire, not deplete your spirit or lead you to neglect your own needs.

    Overloving when we prioritize others above ourselves can lead to emotional exhaustion, stress, or even depression. It's crucial to remember that while love is a powerful force, it should not come at the expense of our mental or physical health. By practicing self-love, we create a space where all forms of love can flourish without fear of losing ourselves. Embrace your worth, honor your needs, and recognize that loving yourself is not selfish it's the first step toward building healthy, meaningful relationships with those around you.</p>
